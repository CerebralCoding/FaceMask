# FaceMask

FaceMask is a Swift command line application for automatic blurring of faces in videos.

It's built using the core components from my now defunct app Blufa.

*Please note I'm in the process of cleaning up the old codebase!*

## Dependencies

Notcurses is used for the TUI. Ensure it is installed via:

```
brew install notcurses
```
